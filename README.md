My paintings are about my connection to the world around me. An obsessive attention to detail has been an obstacle to overcome as a painter and as a craftsman in other fields. In software development I find my detail-oriented nature to be one of my greatest strengths. Having the patience to comb through lines of code to troubleshoot and fix errors has been instrumental to my success and oddly satisfying in an outsized way. 

As a Tech Elevator Bootcamp student I feel as though I've found my people. It's been fun to nerd out with fellow gamers and data geeks about why and how a method or code structure works the way it does within the confines of our program. Even if my dream of becoming a video game developer may be a pipe dream, I look forward to the joy I know I could find in the realm of development and testing for any software development company. 

I embrace the fact that as a software developer I am learning constantly, continuing to research and update my skill set. I've learned so much in such a short time and I look forward to finding out how much more I still don't know a year or ten years from now. I'd love to hear from you if you'd like to know more about me or if there is anything you think I can learn from you!
